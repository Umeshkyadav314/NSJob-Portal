Project Documentation
Overview
This project is built using Next.js, a powerful React framework with built-in support for server-side rendering, API routes, and more. It follows a folder-based routing approach, with each file in the pages/ directory automatically becoming a route in the application.

API Routes
Next.js API routes allow you to build back-end functionality within the same project. These routes are defined in the pages/api/ directory.

Example API Route: pages/api/hello.js
Path: /api/hello
Description: Returns a simple JSON object { message: "Hello, world!" }. You can expand this file to include any server-side logic, such as database queries or external API calls.
